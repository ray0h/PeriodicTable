# Periodic Table

Front End practice using React [(Create React App)](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was inspired by various online periodic tables such as [PTable](https://ptable.com) and [Royal Society of Chemistry](https://www.rsc.org/periodic-table).  Many of the features here were blatantly copied from those sites.  

This project recreated an interactive periodic table featuring miscellaneous physical and thermodynamic property data.  A `select` tag changes the data featured across the 
whole table.  Clicking on the individual element boxes highlights it and shows a box with all available data for the element.  

Various element groupings (e.g. alkali metals) are color coded and can be highlighted on mouseover.
